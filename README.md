## CryptoSoft
Our application to help you to encrypt and decrypt different type files.

## EasySave
EasySave is a backup application that offers advanced features to improve the efficiency of your file backups. With EasySave, you can now backup your files in parallel, which significantly speeds up the backup process. The prioritization of files ensures that the most important files are backed up first.

To avoid saturating the bandwidth, EasySave prohibits simultaneous transfer of files deemed heavy (configurable to your liking). For more flexibility, the application allows you to pause, resume, and stop each job or all jobs at any time.

EasySave also has a feature that temporarily pauses file transfers if it detects the operation of a business software. This ensures that backups do not interfere with the use of your professional applications.

With all these features, EasySave is the ideal backup solution for businesses looking for a fast, efficient, and easy-to-manage backup.
